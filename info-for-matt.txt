------------------------- Usage example from a unix box:

---- Preliminaries:

Ensure name/email set so history will show who/where made a change:
   [ git config --global user.name "Your Name" ]
   [ git config --global user.email account@HOSTNAME.PLATFORM   ]
# will help by showng from who/where a change got made in history

---- Coping an existing repo:

  - [ git clone http://github.com/foundersandsurvivors/ap20-geo.git ]
    # clones the repo as dir "ap20-geo"

---- Usage:

  - [ cd ap20-geo ]

  - # check the status: [ git status ]
trace: built-in: git 'status'
# On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)


  - # switch to branch dev-matt: [ git checkout dev-matt ]
trace: built-in: git 'checkout' 'dev-matt'
Branch dev-matt set up to track remote branch dev-matt from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'dev-matt'

  - edit/test code....
    # e.g. I edited this file: info-for-matt.txt 

  - [ git status ]
trace: built-in: git 'status'
# On branch dev-matt
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#       info-for-matt.txt
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

  - add the new file: [ git add info-for-matt.txt ]
trace: built-in: git 'add' 'info-for-matt.txt'

  - [ git status ]
trace: built-in: git 'status'
# On branch dev-matt
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
#
#       new file:   info-for-matt.txt
#
