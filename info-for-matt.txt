===========================================================================

Entered commands are in [square brackets]

Example: https://github.com/foundersandsurvivors/ap20-geo
   - login to github
   - go to https://github.com/foundersandsurvivors/ap20-geo
   - click "Settings" on right panel
   - click "Collaborators" on left panel
     2 teams shown:
      foundersandsurvivors/owners (only ssilcot here)
      foundersandsurvivors/geo-developers (ssilcot and mattcoller here)
      * Note I set up geo-developers with pull, push and admin rights for this repo

There are 2 branches in foundersandsurvivors/ap20-geo
  - master (always be valid; is the latest stable release)
  - dev-matt ( for mattcoller to develop in)

------------------------- Usage example from a unix box:

---- Preliminaries:

Ensure name/email set so history will show who/where made a change:
   [ git config --global user.name "Your Name" ]
   [ git config --global user.email account@HOSTNAME.PLATFORM   ]
# will help by showng from who/where a change got made in history

---- Coping an existing repo:

  - [ git clone http://github.com/foundersandsurvivors/ap20-geo.git ]
    # clones the repo as dir "ap20-geo"

---- Usage:

  - [ cd ap20-geo ]

  - # check the status: [ git status ]
trace: built-in: git 'status'
# On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)


  - # switch to branch dev-matt: [ git checkout dev-matt ]
trace: built-in: git 'checkout' 'dev-matt'
Branch dev-matt set up to track remote branch dev-matt from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'dev-matt'

  - edit/test code....
    # e.g. I edited this file: info-for-matt.txt 

  - [ git status ]
trace: built-in: git 'status'
# On branch dev-matt
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#       info-for-matt.txt
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

  - add the new file: [ git add info-for-matt.txt ]
trace: built-in: git 'add' 'info-for-matt.txt'

  - [ git status ]
trace: built-in: git 'status'
# On branch dev-matt
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
#
#       new file:   info-for-matt.txt
#

  - commit the change: [ git commit -a -m "Added info-for-matt.txt" ]
trace: built-in: git 'commit' '-a' '-m' 'Added info-for-matt.txt'
[dev-matt 66ea687] Added info-for-matt.txt
 1 file changed, 73 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 info-for-matt.txt

  - [ git status ]
trace: built-in: git 'status'
# On branch dev-matt
# Your branch is ahead of 'origin/dev-matt' by 1 commit.
#
nothing to commit (working directory clean)

  - to see what would happen if we pushed up to githib
    # ASSUMES you have followed section below "when you get sick of"
    # If not you'll be prompted for your gitgub account name and password:
    [ git push --dry-run ]

Enter passphrase for key '/home/ssilcot/.ssh/ssilcot@github.com':
To github:foundersandsurvivors/ap20-geo.git
   4684ce8..66ea687  dev-matt -> dev-matt

  - ok lets do it: [ git push ]

    

================================== some useful aliases I use:

alias gcommit='git commit -a -m'               # You can then edit in your commit message.
alias gls='git ls-files -t'                    # lists files
alias glst='git ls-tree -r HEAD|cut -c54-'     # as above but works in bare repos
alias gpush='git push --dry-run -v'            # show what would happen if we push 
alias gpush-do='git push -v'

================================== when you get sick of entering username/password:

Read this: https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys

Example:

  - generating an ADDITIONAL key just for github:
  [ cd ~/.ssh ]
  [ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "yourname@github.com" ]
     -- enter a passphrase; save the file to yourname@github.com
     -- permissions must be 600 on the key file and 644 on the .pub
  [ ssh -i 'ssilcot@github.com' -T git@github.com ]

  - Paste it into github: foundersandsurvivors / ap20-geo > Settings > Deploy keys
  giving it the name 'yourname@github.com"

  - Test it:  [ ssh -i 'yourname@github.com' -T git@github.com ]
Warning: Permanently added the RSA host key for IP address '******' to the list of known hosts.
Enter passphrase for key 'yourname@github.com':
Hi foundersandsurvivors/ap20-geo! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

  - Enter a shortcut in your ssh config file: [ vi ~/.ssh/config ]
Host github
     Hostname github.com
     User git
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/yourname@github.com

  - And again, using the shortcut: [ ssh -T github ]
Warning: Permanently added the RSA host key for IP address '******' to the list of known hosts.
Enter passphrase for key 'username@github.com':
Hi foundersandsurvivors/ap20-geo! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

  - now modify the .git/config to use your shortcut:
    #OLD: url = http://github.com/foundersandsurvivors/ap20-geo.git
    url = github:foundersandsurvivors/ap20-geo.git

  - now you can push to github and you'll just be prompted for your passphrase: [ git push --dry-run ]
Enter passphrase for key '/home/ssilcot/.ssh/ssilcot@github.com':
To github:foundersandsurvivors/ap20-geo.git
   4684ce8..66ea687  dev-matt -> dev-matt
